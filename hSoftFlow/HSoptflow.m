% This MATLAB code shows a Motion Estimation map created by
% using a Horn and Schunck motion estimation technique on two
% consecutive frames.  Input requires.
%     Xrgb(h,w,d,N) where X is a frame sequence of a certain
%                height(h), width (w), depth (d=3 for color), 
%                and number of frames (N). 
%     n= is the starting frame number which is less than N 
%     V= the output variable which is a 2D velocity array
%
% Sample Call: V=HSoptflow(X,3);
